# 325-Birds-Classifications
Classifications of 325 different classes of birds without using Transfer Learning
The dataset available at - https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species

Problem: 
 The dataset contains 325 species of different birds. the challenge here is to build a model so when providing a bird image to the model, it can accurately predict the species of the bird.

Challenges:
 One of the challenges to this problem was the dataset is huge so not suitable for training in local computers. also, the bird images provided were not sufficient, means there is not enough images to make the model accurate( general thumb of rule 10,000 images atleast per class in case of deep learning).

Solution and Model training:
 Well, I used google Colab for research purpose so I don't have to use my local environment. I can go for transfer learning in case of shortage of images, but I didn't go because I want to build a model from scratch rather than a model that is already trained on bigger dataset.
